# DisableGrowthMeter
#### Experimental fix to stop the Maneater from growing up after its growth meter gets too high

Usage is pretty simple, install the mod and that's it.  
I do recommend you use in tandem with [NormalBabies](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zorfi/NormalBabies/) however.  

## Notes
- This mod alone does ***not*** disable transformation altogether on its own, it simply stops the growth meter from increasing. **Use in tandem with [NormalBabies](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zorfi/NormalBabies/) for this functionality!**
- This mod *will* probably break in a week when it decides to explode. Fix it if you'd like, the code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/restorerootfs/DisableGrowthMeter).
